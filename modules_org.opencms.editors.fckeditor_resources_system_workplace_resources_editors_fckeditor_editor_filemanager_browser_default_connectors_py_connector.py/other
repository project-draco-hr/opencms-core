"\nAuthor Notes (04 December 2005):\nThis module has gone through quite a few phases of change.  Obviously,\nI am only supporting that part of the code that I use.  Initially\nI had the upload directory as a part of zope (ie. uploading files\ndirectly into Zope), before realising that there were too many\ncomplex intricacies within Zope to deal with.  Zope is one ugly piece\nof code.  So I decided to complement Zope by an Apache server (which\nI had running anyway, and doing nothing).  So I mapped all uploads\nfrom an arbitrary server directory to an arbitrary web directory.\nAll the FCKeditor uploading occurred this way, and I didn't have to\nstuff around with fiddling with Zope objects and the like (which are\nterribly complex and something you don't want to do - trust me).\n\nMaybe a Zope expert can touch up the Zope components.  In the end,\nI had FCKeditor loaded in Zope (probably a bad idea as well), and\nI replaced the connector.py with an alias to a server module.\nRight now, all Zope components will simple remain as is because\nI've had enough of Zope.\n\nSee notes right at the end of this file for how I aliased out of Zope.\n\nAnyway, most of you probably wont use Zope, so things are pretty\nsimple in that regard.\n\nTypically, SERVER_DIR is the root of WEB_DIR (not necessarily).\nMost definitely, SERVER_USERFILES_DIR points to WEB_USERFILES_DIR.\n"
